This folder saves the real data correlation structure used in simulation, and the list of four gene sets used in real data analysis. 

## simulation
A large number of data files were generated for simulation experiments and they can all be reproduced following code/simulation/README.md. As a result, we did not include simulated data files here.

We provide here two correlation matrices used for setting true co-expression structures in the simulation experiments in Section 3. They were used to generate the results in Table S4.
1. Excitatory Neurons_p_100_th_0.6_spcones_cor
2. Excitatory Neurons_p_200_th_0.6_spcones_cor

## real_data

We did not save any gene expression data from the ROSMAP study here per data policy. We share here the four gene lists studied in Section 4.
